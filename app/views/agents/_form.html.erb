<p>YOUR AGENT - Who do you want to make decisions for you when you canâ€™t?</p>
<p>The person you select as your agent is extremely important. This person may make health care decisions on your
  behalf if you cannot and may have to decide when to stop treatment. It is important that you select someone who
  understands how you want to be treated and will fight for that if necessary. </p>
<p>Who would you like to make medical choices on your behalf if you cannot make them yourself?</p>

TODO:
<p>In case your first choice is not able, not willing, or not available to make medical decisions for you, who would
  you like to name as your alternate agent? You can name as many as you like (Optional)</p>

<p>Your agent will have authority to make all health care choices for you if the primary doctor treating you and one
  other doctor find that you are not able to make your own choices.</p>

<p>Your agent will have the authority to make decisions to provide, prohibit, or remove feeding tubes, ventilators,
  and other artificial means of keeping you alive.</p>

<p>Your agent will do their very best to act in your best interest and to follow your instructions.</p>
