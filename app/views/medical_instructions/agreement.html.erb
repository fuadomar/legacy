      <h2>Why You need End of life Instructions?</h2>
      <p>
        Do you want doctors prolong your life at all costs? Do you want
        to be kept artificially alive even if you have no hope for
        recovery? Wold you prefer to die comfortably at home or in
        a comfort care facility?
      </p>
      <p>
        The default protocol of many hospitals and doctors is to keep
        you alive, sometimes at very little benefit to your quality of life.
        You have the right to choose the type of care you want at the end
        of your life. But, unless you make your instructions known is a legal
        document doctors and hospitals may perform aggressive treatments to
        keep you artificially alive.
      </p>
      <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
      <p class="first">
        In emergency situations outside of hospitals, EMTs and doctors
        will automatically perform lifesaving treatments unless you are wearing
        a MedicAlert bracelet. The law assumes that you give emergency
        responders permission to save your life. So End of Life Instructions rarely
        come into play for situations that occur outside of hospitals and other medical
        facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are admitted to the hospital with a life threatening condition,the
        hospital will ask your physician or your family if you have created legal End
        of Life Instructions. Complete End of Life Instructions have two parts. The first
        describes the types of treatment you want and donâ€™t want. The second part appoints
        your agent who will make decisions for you if you are unable to make them for yourself.
