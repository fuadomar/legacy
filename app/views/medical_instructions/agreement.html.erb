      <h2>What is an advance medical directive?</h2>
      <p>
        As long as you are able to make decisions for yourself, you 
        don't need an advance medical directive. An advance medical 
        directive is a set of important decisions you can make so that
        you and your family will get what you want if you are to become
        incapacitated or unable to make decisions for yourself, such as if 
        you were to get into an accident, or have a health issue that renders 
        you unconscious or unable to communicate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The default protocol of most hospitals and doctors is to keep
        you alive, sometimes at very little benefit to your quality of life.
        You have the right to choose the type of care you want at the end
        of your life. But, unless you make your instructions known in a legal
        document, doctors and hospitals may perform aggressive treatments to
        keep you alive. You don't need a lawyer to do this - all that's needed
        to make an advance directive legal is your signature, and two witnesses. 
      </p>
      <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
      <p class="first">
        In emergency situations outside of hospitals, EMTs and doctors
        will automatically perform lifesaving treatments unless you are wearing
        a MedicAlert bracelet. The law assumes that you give emergency
        responders permission to save your life. So End of Life Instructions rarely
        come into play for situations that occur outside of hospitals and other medical
        facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are admitted to the hospital with a life threatening condition,the
        hospital will ask your physician or your family if you have created legal End
        of Life Instructions and who your medical agent is. A complete advance directive will
        have two parts. The first describes the types of treatment you want and donâ€™t want. 
        The second part appoints your agent who will make decisions for you if you are unable 
        to make them for yourself. Your agent choice is the most important choice you can make, 
        as you can never foresee or plan for every possible circumstance.
