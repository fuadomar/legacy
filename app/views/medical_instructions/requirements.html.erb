      <ul>
        <li>Only adults who are of sound mind can create legal End of Life Instructions. So itâ€™s important to create them early. If you suddenly lose the ability to communicate your wishes rationally, it is too late. Your family and doctors may be left guessing.</li>
        <li>Your End of Life Instructions must be signed by two witness or a notary. We will provide you with a document to print out and sign. If you do not collect all necessary signatures, the document may not be considered legal at the hospital.</li>
